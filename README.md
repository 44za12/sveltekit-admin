# Windmill for SvelteKit

This is made possible and most of the design was based from the [Estevan Maito's](https://github.com/estevanmaito/windmill-dashboard) project.

## Here we're using these things
- [SvelteKit](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit)
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- Typescript
- Vite

## Start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
