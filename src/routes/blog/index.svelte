          <p class="pt-5">
            <span class="pl-5" />To give you a background about my life, I was born on Feb 22, 1991
            in the Philippines, when I was kid we're limited to what we have, the first time I
            touched a computer was when I was around ~8 years old and that computer was from my
            Uncle, my father tought me how to play that Solitaire thing in Windows NT, lmao.
          </p>

          <p class="pt-5">
            <span class="pl-5" />Fast forward, it all started there, the passion / appreciation on
            how games work, I'm fascinated with FPS and RPG games; when I am in High School and I am
            motivated to create one! (Hell no, I wasn't able to! LOL). Hence, I was able to create
            my own Street Fighter (simple sprite extracted online) and I wrote it in JavaSE in my
            University Years! And yes I'm one of the University who received a Best Software
            Engineering (of that year).
          </p>

          <p class="pt-5">
            <span class="pl-5" />Throughout my Career, I started as a Fullstack Engineer, so I still
            have knowledge with Frontend Techology (see this website? this is written in SvelteJS
            for your info), nowadays more on R&D and Architectural in the Backend Side and some
            DevOps knowledge too.

      I've been following open source projects since in my High School years, one of them was gaming
      tools such as bots written in Perl and a game engine written in C++ that runs a private
      server.

    <p class="pt-5">
      By then, I started to follow opensource projects, it all started in SourceForge and now in
